# Will we remember today's hits in ten years?


### By Jose Maria Ramos Ugalde

Sinnce the creation of the Billboard "Hot 100" chart in 1958, only 3% of the tracks that reached the number one spot have remained on top for 10 weeks or more. 

The Hot 100 is widely considered the definitive all-genre singles chart in the US. In its 62-year history, over 1,000 songs have reached the coveted No. 1 spot, but far fewer have reigned long enough to hit the milestone of double-digit weeks â€” or, even more impressively, surpass it.

Only 39 songs have achieved the rare feat, for this project we will "scrappe" a website in order to get a list of the 50 songs that reigned this Billboard chart the longest.

Once we acquire our Billboard list we will get their song features using the Spotify API, this features include key, modality, danceability, acousticness, energy and liveness, among others.

We will also get the songs for the Spotify "Global Top 50" playlist and their features.

Once we have "scrapped" this info from the website and the API we will have two data sets, one for each chart.
Last but not least we'll do the required cleaning for each data set and store it in a CSV file, therefore in the future we will be able to conduct analysis and try to anticipate wether one of today's top hits has what it takes to make history in the music business.
